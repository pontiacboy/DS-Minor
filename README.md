# DS-Minor Max de Goede
Work from Max de Goede on the Data Science Minor. Here you will find a list of my findings on the following:
## 1. ML Introduction
## 2. ANN (Artifician Neural Network)
For the artificial neural network exercise i used a dataset from Mnist. Here i used the fashion Mnist dataset and tried to create a network that would predict the clothing. The main goal here was to create my first networks using the Tensorflow and Keras libraries. Here i played with the hyperparameters such as:
1. Hidden layers
2. Learning rate
3. Epochs
